Private Network:
Set up a switch, server and a PC
Connect the entities through a copper straight through cable
Give an IP address for the PC and subnet mask
Ping the server with our PC
Go to the server and start and FTP server with username and password


Public Network:
Step-1: Set up a topology: Star topology
Step-2: Each system has a dedicated Server
Step-3: Configure the Router and add the hardware pieces
Step-4: Wire up through gigabit ethernet ports and copper straight through cables
Step-5: Establish Internetwork communication by IOS codes Ref-1
Step-6: Start pinging other internetwork PCs and Servers


Works to be done:
FTP in-between networks is posing a problem
Finding a way (Protocol) to broadcast packets 
Software part of the application is mostly unsupportive
